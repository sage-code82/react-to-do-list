# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# GET SHIT DONE APP

This initially was a task I started at home as a Saturday afternoon project to help me stay ontop of how REACT, useState and components work.
MVP was to have an app that fit the following user story :

As a user I want to be able to quickly note down on my computer a small list of things todo.
As a user I want to be able to mark off, edit and delete tasks

STRETCH GOAL : Confettie falls when a task is done.

### Takeaways

All the info I needed was in there! However it was all abit jumbled up with the details about API's I had learned this week. (I set all the components as .js files for example) Would this of been easier to do in vanilla JavaScript? Probably.

I also fell foul a couple of times of the classic steve case error, where I nothing was working and I could not see why. A capital D was throwing my code out of sync entirely! Thanks to GJ from the Tech Educators cohort for finding that gem for me! It is a common thing that keeps coming up with my code but thankfully this does mean that my logic is A o K!

The stretch goal of the confetti was going to be that emoji's would fall from the top of the screen, while i got the basese of the animation to work I did run out of time when it came to working on this so decided to park that for now.

I also need to come back and work on the CSS as when I get to more than 6 or 7 task the todolist does go "off the page" and this needs to be fixed.
